### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin? You can start by looking through issues labeled:

- Write clear, descriptive commit messages
- Include screenshots in your pull request when making UI changes
- End all files with a newline
- Avoid platform-dependent code

## Development Workflow

### Branch Naming Convention

- `feature/feature-name` - For new features
- `fix/bug-description` - For bug fixes
- `docs/description` - For documentation changes
- `refactor/description` - For code refactoring
- `test/description` - For adding or updating tests

### Development Process

1. **Create a new branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes**
   
   Follow the [style guidelines](#style-guidelines) and write clean, maintainable code.

3. **Test your changes**
   ```bash
   pnpm run build
   pnpm run preview
   ```

4. **Commit your changes**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add awesome feature"
   ```

5. **Push to your fork**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

6. **Open a Pull Request**
   
   Go to the original repository and click "New Pull Request".

## Style Guidelines

### TypeScript Style Guide

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Use interfaces over types when possible
- Prefer `const` over `let`, avoid `var`
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Use arrow functions for callbacks

```typescript
// Good
const calculateTotal = (items: Item[]): number => {
  return items.reduce((sum, item) => sum + item.price, 0);
};

// Avoid
function calculateTotal(items) {
  var sum = 0;
  for (var i = 0; i < items.length; i++) {
    sum = sum + items[i].price;
  }
  return sum;
}
```

### React Component Guidelines

- Use functional components with hooks
- Keep components small and focused
- Extract reusable logic into custom hooks
- Use meaningful prop names
- Add prop types/interfaces

```typescript
// Good
interface ButtonProps {
  label: string;
  onClick: () => void;
  variant?: 'primary' | 'secondary';
  disabled?: boolean;
}

export const Button: React.FC<ButtonProps> = ({
  label,
  onClick,
  variant = 'primary',
  disabled = false
}) => {
  return (
    <button
      className={`btn btn-${variant}`}
      onClick={onClick}
      disabled={disabled}
    >
      {label}
    </button>
  );
};
```

### CSS/TailwindCSS Guidelines

- Use TailwindCSS utility classes
- Follow mobile-first responsive design
- Use the glassmorphism components from `ui/GlassComponents.tsx`
- Maintain consistent spacing and sizing
- Use theme colors and variables

### File Structure

```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ui/              # Reusable UI components
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ tools/           # Tool components

## Commit Guidelines

<body>

<footer>
```

### Types

- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Changes that don't affect code meaning (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf`: Performance improvements
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Changes to build process or auxiliary tools

### Examples

```bash

- Added sin, cos, tan functions
- Added support for radians and degrees
- Updated UI with new button layout

Closes #123
```

```bash
fix(timer): resolve notification sound playing multiple times

The notification sound was triggering multiple times due to 
duplicate useEffect dependencies.

Fixes #456
```

## Additional Notes

### Adding New Tools

When adding a new tool:

1. Create component in `src/components/tools/`
2. Add icon import to `App.tsx`
3. Register tool in `toolCategories` object
4. Add route case in `renderContent` function
5. Update documentation

### Working with IndexedDB

- Use Dexie.js wrapper (`src/lib/database.ts`)
- Always handle errors appropriately
- Test with actual data
- Consider data migration if schema changes

### PWA Considerations

- Test offline functionality
- Ensure service worker updates correctly
- Verify manifest.json changes
- Test on mobile devices
