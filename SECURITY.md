# Security Policy

## Overview

Tooltip is a privacy-first, client-side application that runs entirely in your browser. We take security seriously and appreciate the security community's efforts to responsibly disclose vulnerabilities.

## Supported Versions

We release patches for security vulnerabilities for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.x.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.0   | :x:                |

## Security Features

### Client-Side Only Architecture

- **No Server Communication**: Tooltip runs entirely in your browser with no data transmission to external servers
- **Local Storage Only**: All data is stored locally using IndexedDB in your browser
- **No Analytics**: We don't track, collect, or analyze user data
- **No Third-Party APIs**: No external API calls (except when you explicitly use tools like QR code generation)

### Data Privacy

- **Offline First**: Full functionality available offline via PWA
- **No Cookies**: We don't use cookies for tracking
- **No Authentication**: No user accounts or authentication required
- **Browser Isolation**: Data is isolated per browser/device

### Content Security

- **XSS Protection**: React's built-in XSS protection
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated
- **Safe Rendering**: No dangerouslySetInnerHTML usage
- **TypeScript**: Type safety to prevent common vulnerabilities

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take all security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### 1. **Do Not** Create a Public Issue

Please **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities. Public disclosure could put users at risk.

### 2. Report Privately

Send an email to the maintainers with:

- **Subject**: "SECURITY: [Brief Description]"
- **Description**: Detailed description of the vulnerability
- **Impact**: Potential impact and attack scenarios
- **Steps to Reproduce**: Step-by-step instructions
- **Proof of Concept**: Code or screenshots if applicable
- **Suggested Fix**: If you have ideas for fixing (optional)

### 3. What to Expect

- **Acknowledgment**: We'll acknowledge receipt within 48 hours
- **Assessment**: We'll assess the vulnerability and its impact
- **Updates**: We'll keep you informed of our progress
- **Resolution**: We aim to resolve critical issues within 7 days
- **Credit**: We'll credit you in the release notes (if desired)

### 4. Disclosure Policy

- We request that you give us reasonable time to address the issue before public disclosure
- We'll coordinate with you on the disclosure timeline
- We'll credit you for the discovery (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)

## Security Best Practices for Users

### Browser Security

1. **Keep Your Browser Updated**: Always use the latest version of your browser
2. **Use HTTPS**: Access the application via HTTPS when hosted
3. **Browser Extensions**: Be cautious with browser extensions that might access your data
4. **Clear Data**: Use browser tools to clear IndexedDB if needed

### Data Security

1. **Sensitive Information**: Avoid storing highly sensitive information in notes/tasks
2. **Device Security**: Use device encryption and screen locks
3. **Public Devices**: Don't use Tooltip on public/shared devices for sensitive data
4. **Browser Privacy Mode**: Data in incognito/private mode is cleared when session ends

### PWA Security

1. **Service Workers**: Service workers cache files for offline use
2. **Cache Clearing**: Clear browser cache to remove stored application files
3. **Permissions**: Review and manage browser permissions granted to the PWA

## Known Security Considerations

### Local Storage Risks

- **Data Accessibility**: Anyone with physical access to your device can access data stored in IndexedDB
- **Browser Extensions**: Malicious extensions could potentially access local storage
- **Recommendation**: Use device-level encryption and security measures

### Browser Vulnerabilities

- **Browser Bugs**: Security depends on browser security
- **Third-Party Libraries**: We use well-maintained libraries, but vulnerabilities can occur
- **Recommendation**: Keep browsers updated and review our dependencies

### QR Code Generation

- **URL Safety**: QR codes can contain malicious URLs
- **User Responsibility**: Users are responsible for content encoded in QR codes
- **Recommendation**: Verify QR code content before sharing

## Vulnerability Disclosure Timeline

1. **Day 0**: Vulnerability reported
2. **Day 1-2**: Acknowledgment and initial assessment
3. **Day 3-7**: Investigation and fix development
4. **Day 7-14**: Testing and verification
5. **Day 14-21**: Release preparation and coordinated disclosure
6. **Day 21+**: Public disclosure and security advisory

## Security Audits

We welcome security audits and reviews:

- **Code Review**: Our code is open source for community review
- **Dependency Scanning**: We use automated tools to scan dependencies
- **Regular Updates**: We keep dependencies up to date
- **Security Patches**: We prioritize security patches

## Security-Related Configuration

### Content Security Policy

When self-hosting, consider implementing CSP headers:

```
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; img-src 'self' data:; font-src 'self' data:;
```

### HTTPS Configuration

Always serve over HTTPS in production:

```
- Use Let's Encrypt for free SSL certificates
- Configure HSTS headers
- Implement proper redirect from HTTP to HTTPS
```

## Dependencies

We regularly update and monitor our dependencies:

- **React**: UI framework with security updates
- **Vite**: Build tool with security considerations
- **TailwindCSS**: CSS framework
- **Dexie.js**: IndexedDB wrapper
- **qrcode**: QR code generation library

### Dependency Security

```bash
# Check for vulnerabilities
pnpm audit

# Update dependencies
pnpm update
```
